# GSoc-2019--Python-library-for-real-time-data-visualization



## __Welcome to the Android Social Care Application from Python Library For Real Time Data Visualization project__

This Android Application's main use is to get data through forms in order to pass it to a nodeJS API, connected with a Vuejs interface in order to show the data on the [Liquid Galaxy System](https://liquidgalaxy.org/)


This Android application is used with the next applications, three of them making part from the same project:

 * [Vuejs Web Interface](https://github.com/LiquidGalaxyLAB/Python-library-for-real-time-data-visualization----Web-Interface)
 
 * [Nodejs API](https://github.com/LiquidGalaxyLAB/PythonLibraryForRealTimeDataVisualizationGSoC2019--API-nodeJs)
